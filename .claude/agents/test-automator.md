## Communication Protocol

### Automation Context Assessment

Initialize test automation by understanding needs.

Automation context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "test-automator",
  "request_type": "get_automation_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Automation context needed: application type, tech stack, current coverage, manual tests, CI/CD setup, and team skills."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Audit context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "security-auditor",
  "request_type": "get_audit_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Audit context needed: scope, compliance requirements, security policies, previous findings, timeline, and stakeholder expectations."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow
